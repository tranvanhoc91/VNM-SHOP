== Description ==

*Mobile Contact Bar is a compact and highly customizable plugin, which allows your visitors to contact you directly via phone, email, Social Media, or any custom URL.*

Display settings for bar, icons and contacts are editable under the *Settings &rarr; Mobile Contact Bar* menu in WordPress Admin.

The contact bar appears if at least one contact information is set, and on those screens where the width is below of the *Maximum Screen Width* setting.

= Features =

* Set your contact information and Social Media profiles
* Design bar and icons via plugin settings or directly via CSS
* Change the order of the icons as you wish
* Add subject, body, cc, bcc parameters to email, add predefined text messages
* Show or hide bar toggle - depending on your needs
* Add custom URLs using the `mcb_admin_update_contacts` filter and [Font Awesome Icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)

*Administration Hooks*

* `mcb_admin_update_contacts( array $contacts )` filter allows you to modify the *Contact List* section. Typically, you add new items to that list.

* `mcb_admin_update_settings( array $settings )` filter allows you to modify the *Bar Display Settings* section and the *Icon Display Settings* section. If you can not wait for the official enhancement, you can add settings to those sections by yourself.


*Front end Hooks*

* `mcb_front_escape_uri( string $uri, string $id, string $protocol, string $resource )` filter allows you to perform custom specification and validation of a contactâ€™s reference. The plugin already supports the `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `skype`, `sms` and the `tel` protocols.

* `mcb_front_render_html( array $contacts, array $settings )` action gives you full control over the representation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want to display contacts which are not listed on the MCB settings page like SlideShare, Reddit or Steam. Can I do that? =

Yes, you can. The `mcb_admin_update_contacts` filter allows you to modify the contact list. You can add new items to that list, and they will appear at the bottom of the MCB settings page. For proper icon names check the [Font Awesome Icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).

E.g. insert the following code snippet to your active theme's `functions.php` file:

    function my_mcb_admin_update_contacts( $contacts ) {

        $contacts['slideshare'] = array(
            'icon'        => 'slideshare',   // Font Awesome Icon name
            'title'       => 'SlideShare',
            'protocol'    => 'http',
            'placeholder' => 'http://www.slideshare.net/username'
        );
        return $contacts;
    }

    add_filter( 'mcb_admin_update_contacts', 'my_mcb_admin_update_contacts' );


= How can I fine-tune the display of my contact bar using CSS styles? =

Enter custom CSS using the `#mcb-bar` and `#mcb-toggle` selectors, and that will override the styles defined by the plugin.

E.g. insert the following code snippet to your active theme's `style.css` file:

    #mcb-bar {
        background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #2a95c5, #21759b);
        text-shadow: 0 1px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    }

    #mcb-bar .fa {
        color: #fff;
        text-decoration: none;
    }

    #mcb-bar ul li,
    #mcb-bar ul li:first-child {
        border-color: #fff;
        border-width: 2px;
    }

    #mcb-toggle:before {
        background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #2a95c5, #21759b);
    }


= Different styles on front-page and on the rest of the site =

WordPress adds `home` class to the `body` tag of the front-page. Narrow down the MCB related selection with the `.home` class selector:

    .home #mcb-bar .fa {
        color: yellow;
    }


= I need a copyright icon which links visitors to my copyright page =

Use the `mcb_admin_update_contacts` filter for adding the [copyright](http://fontawesome.io/icon/copyright/) icon to the contact list. Enter the URL of your existing page to the newly created contact item.

    function my_mcb_admin_update_contacts( $contacts ) {

        $contacts['copyright'] = array(
            'icon'        => 'copyright',   // Font Awesome Icon name
            'title'       => 'Copyright',
            'protocol'    => 'http',
            'placeholder' => 'http://mysite.com/mycopyrightpage'
        );
        return $contacts;
    }

    add_filter( 'mcb_admin_update_contacts', 'my_mcb_admin_update_contacts' );
